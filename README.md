# multilevel-queue-scheduling

Ques: 
Write a program for multilevel queue scheduling algorithm. There must be three queues generated. There must be a specific range of priority associated with every queue. Now prompt the user to enter a number of processes along with their priority and burst time. Each process must occupy the respective queue with a specific priority range according to its priority. Apply Round Robin algorithm with quantum time 4 on queue with highest priority range. Apply priority scheduling algorithm on the queue with medium range of priority and First come first serve algorithm on the queue with lowest range of priority. Each and every queue should get a quantum time of 10 seconds. The CPU will keep on shifting between queues after every 10 seconds.



Trying to summerize the questions:-: 
In this question, you are asked to write a program that implements a multilevel queue scheduling algorithm.
The user should be prompted to enter a number of processes along with their priority and burst time.
The program should then apply the Round Robin algorithm with a quantum time of 4 seconds to the queue with the highest priority range.
The CPU should keep shifting between queues every 10 seconds.
In summary, the program should implement a multilevel queue scheduling algorithm that assigns processes to three queues based on their priority, applies different scheduling algorithms to each queue, and shifts the CPU between queues every 10 seconds.
